let name = "Samentha";
let age = 35;

// This is how I am writting a variable while printing its value with string, simply using
// concatination but this is old way and can some time not very clean and readable.
console.log("Hello My Name Is " + name + " And I Am " + age + " Years Old.");

// So now days we use `` (Backticks) to write such things as give below
console.log(`Hello My Name Is ${name} And I Am ${age} Years Old.`);
// This is called STRING INTERPOLATION.
// Although output is same for both but this is good practice.

// THERE ARE MANY METHOD OF STRING THAT WE CAN USE, Check mdn.
